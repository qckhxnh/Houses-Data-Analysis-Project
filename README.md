# Houses Data Analysis Project

This is Staffelter Hof Winery, Germany's oldest business, which was established in 862 under the Carolingian dynasty. It has continued to serve customers through dramatic changes in Europe such as the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and both world wars. What characteristics enable a business to stand the test of time?

To help answer this question, BusinessFinancing.co.uk <a href="https://businessfinancing.co.uk/the-oldest-company-in-almost-every-country">researched</a> the oldest company that is still in business in almost every country and compiled the results into a dataset. In this project, I explored this dataset in order to better understand these histtoric properties.
